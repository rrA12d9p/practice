# Spring Flowers

This garden of flowers is a mess! Time to clean it up a bit...

* Some things are broken...fix them!
* Refactor
* DRY it up
* Proper indentation
* Stick to semantic names and style guide conventions
* Split up the classes and other functionality in to the appropriate files using require_relative
